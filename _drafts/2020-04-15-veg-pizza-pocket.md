Stuffing is ready. Turn off the gas and remove the pan from the gas and keep it on a lattice stand and let the vegetables cool down.

When the stuffing cools down, add mozzarella cheese to it and mix it well.

After the dough is set, apply a little oil on your hands and mash the dough a little. After this, make 3 equal pieces of dough. Take a dough and knead it with your hands and give it a round shape, place it on a rolling board and roll it out with a rolling pin. Cut the rolled dough into 9 inch and 4.5 inch width rectangular sheets from the edges.

Cut this sheet into two parts in length and width. Apply water around the edges of the sheet. After this, put a little stuffing in one piece and spread it lengthwise while leaving the edge and spread a little stuffing on the other piece also. Put the plane sheet on top of the stuffing sheet and apply pressure with light hands on all four sides. Cover the second stuffing sheet with another plane sheet and paste it.

Keep these pizza puffs in the fridge for 1/2 hour.

To make pizza puff, heat oil in a pan, oil medium should be heated to fry the pizza puffs. To check the oil is properly heated, put a little piece of flour in it and see if the piece is roasting, then the oil is hot enough.

When the medium is hot oil, take a pizza puff and put it in the hot oil. Fry the pizza puffs until they turn golden brown. When the pizza puff is golden brown, lift it with a ladle and hold it on the side of the pan for a while so that the excess oil goes back into the pan and remove the puff and keep it on a plate. Fry all the pizza puffs in this manner. It takes 6 to 7 minutes to fry a one-time pizza puff.

Hot and crispy pizza puffs are ready, serve them with mustard sauce, tomato sauce or your favorite sauce and eat.

NOTE: 
- If the pizza puffs are kept in the fridge and fried, they do not get bubbles and very good pizza puffs are prepared by flowering. 
- Fry the pizza puff in medium hot oil.
