Simple way to make your own bread crumbs! 

## Ingredients

- 10 slices of any bread you prefer

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
2. Using tongs, place bread slices directly on oven racks. Leave in oven until hard and golden brown, about 30 minutes; darker if you prefer. 
3. If you have a few days you can also sun dry the bread till it's done (takes about two sunny days and 2 nights under a fan)
4. If sun drying remember to switch sides everyday.  
5. Remove and cool on wire rack.
6. Crumble slices into a large bowl until reduced to fine crumbs, or place in bowl of food processor and process until fine.
