A new twist to the classic beaten coffee. We had to give into this trend and I must say we LOVED IT!!

## Ingredients

- 3 Tablespoons instant coffee powder
- 6 Tablespoon Sugar
- 3 Tablespoons Water
- 4 cups of Milk
- Ice cubes

## Method

1. Add instant coffee powder and sugar and bowl(the bowl must be 3-5 times the amount of coffee and sugar, it expands after beating)
2. Add 2 Tablespoons water and beat the coffee and sugar vigrously untill it is light and fluffy and all the sugar dissolves. 
3. Add a few more drops of sugar if required while beating the coffee. 
4. Fill a glass with ice cubes. 
5. Pour milk on top (fill only 3/4th of the glass)
6. Top the glass with whipped coffee.
7. Serve with a spoon and cookies. 
8. Mix well and consume.

Note: Store the remaining beaten coffee in the fridge for 7 days in an airtight container. Don't freeze.
