Egg Pakoras are easy to prepare and make for a perfect snack during cold winter evenings with a cup of hot tea or coffee.

## Ingredients

- 6 Eggs
- 1/2 Cup Gram (Besan) Flour
- 1 Teaspoon Red Chili Powder
- 1/2 Teaspoon Turmeric Powder
- 1/8th Teaspoon Salt or to taste
- 1 Teaspoon Chaat Masala
- 225 ml Water or as required
- Oil for deep frying

## Method

1. Boil all eggs. Let the cool, then deshell.
2. Slice the eggs into halves and set aside.
3. In a bowl, combine flour, turmeric powder, red chilly powder, and salt together.
4. Add water little by little and mix them well to prepare a batter. It should be slightly thinner than Idli batter but not runny like dosa batter.
5. Meanwhile, heat oil in a kadai over medium flame. Once the oil is hot, add a small ball of flour to check the state of oil. If the ball rises steadily, then the oil is hot enough for frying pakoras. If it raises slowly, then the oil should be heated for some more time.
6. Once the oil consistency is perfect, take a slice of egg, dip it in the flour and slowly drop them into the oil.
7. Cook until they turn golden on both the sides by flipping them occasionally.
8. Set them aside in a dish towel and repeat the same procedure for the remaining egg slices.
9. Serve with green chutney.
