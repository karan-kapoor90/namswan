My all time favourite, this was one dessert I've always had as a kid on Diwali. While making this the aroma takes me back to sweet childhood memories. No amount of words can do justice to the warm fuzzy feels you get when this dissolves in your mouth.

## Ingredients

- 1.5 Cup Gram flour (Besan)
- 3/4th Cup Powdered Sugar
- 1/2 Cup Ghee
- 1 Teaspoon Cardamom (Elaichi) Powder
- Roasted Almonds to taste

## Method

1. Sift the Besan. Keep aside.
2. In a kadhai add ghee and besan, saute on slow gas till it changes colour to a dark brown and leaves aroma(takes about half an hour)
3. For besan burfi, heat the sugar while the gas is on.
4. Let it cool a little (cool enough for you to hold it)
5. Take about a teaspoon of cooled batter in your palm and roll into balls.
6. Let it naturally cool completely and then put it in the fridge for a while till it completely cools down. 
7. Serve as is.
