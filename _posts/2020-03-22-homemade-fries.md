Fried snacks! The only memory I have related to these is going for a swim and devouring them after! 


## Ingredients

- 3 medium size potatoes 
- 3.5 cups cold water
- Dry rosemary or oregano or mixed herbs - as required
- Rock salt or black salt or regular salt - as required
- Red chili powder or paprika as required - optional
- Oil for deep frying - as required
- Chaat masala for seasoning
## Method

1. Firstly take the potatoes and rinse well in water. Then peel them. 
2. Slice the potato keeping a 1 cm thickness.
3. Then begin to cut them in 1 cm sticks. 
4. Rinse the sticks a couple of times in water to get rid of the starch.
5. In a bowl take 3.5 cups cold water and dunk the potatoes in it. Keep this bowl outside or in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 45 minutes (In a hot and humid climate keep the bowl in the fridge)
6. After 30 minutes or 45 minutes, drain the potatoes in a colander.
7. Rinse the potatoes with running water. Drain all the water. 
8. Then place them on clean kitchen towel.
9. Place the second half of the napkin above and press, pat and dry the potatoes. The potatoes have to be completely dried before you begin to fry them. 
10. Heat oil in a wok or pan. Keep the flame to medium. The oil should be medium hot.
11. Add the potatoes in the oil. fry in two to three batches to avoid over crowding.
12. Stir often while frying them for uniform cooking.
13. Fry till the potatoes get cooked, but they should not turn brown from outside. They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light golden browning of the edges is fine. 
14. Place the half fried potatoes on paper kitchen towels. Stack 3 to 4 paper towels. Press some paper towels from top also to absorb extra oil. Let the half fried potatoes cool down at room temperature. 
15. After removing this batch, you can fry the second batch of potatoes. By the time you fry the second batch of the potatoes, the first batch will cool down. 16. when you want to consume the potatoes, in the same oil, you can fry the first batch of half fried potatoes.
17. sprinkle chaat masala and Serve hot with ketchup.
