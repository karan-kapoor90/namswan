They make the perfect dessert, they're not too sweet and they're easy and simple to make. Enjoy them after meals or in between a movie. 

## Ingredients

- Dry Fryms
- Oil to Fry
- 1/2 cup Powdered Sugar
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon (or a little more or less to taste)

1. Heat the oil on high temperature and avoid smoking or burning of the oil.
2. Meanwhile,Measure the sugar and cinnamon into a bowl.
3. Use a spoon or mini whisk to mix it together.
4. Put the cinnamon sugar immediately or store it in a jar. 
5. Check if the oil is hot with a piece of frym (drop it in oil and it should expand and come up to the surface)
6. Lower the heat a little bit, somewhere between medium and high.
7. Very carefully slide or drop the fryms . With a slotted spoon, shake them a little bit and when expanded properly and have risen to the surface, take them them out.
8. To remove excess oil, put them  on the paper towels.
9. In a bowl with a lid add the fryms and two tablespoons of cinnamon sugar and mix it thoroughly. 
10. Serve hot or store it in an air tight container so you can enjoy these later!
