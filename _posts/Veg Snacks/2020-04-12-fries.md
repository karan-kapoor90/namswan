Fried snacks! The only memory I have related to these is going for a swim and devouring them after! 


## Ingredients

- 3 medium size potatoes 
- 3.5 cups cold water
- Dry rosemary or oregano or mixed herbs - as required
- Rock salt or black salt or regular salt - as required
- Red chili powder or paprika as required - optional
- Oil for deep frying - as required

## Method

1. Cut the potatoes in 1/2 cm thickness and put them in water for 15 minutes.
2. In a pot, add water and keep it to simmering temperature, and par-boil them.
3. Once done, drain them in a flat tray and spread evenly. Freeze them for 1-1 1/2 hour.
4. Heat oil in a kadhai to medium hot for first frying. Remove them from the freezer and fry them till they're 80% done. Once fried, remove them on a paper towel.
5. Heat oil in a kadhai for second frying. Fry them completely. Remove them on a paper towel.
6. Transfer hot fries in a mixing bowl, sprinkle some salt, paprika powder, herbs and toss well.
7. Serve hot.
