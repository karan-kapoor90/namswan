This recipe for steamed jeera rice will never fail you. Try it, and you will always get fluffy, fragrant rice where every grain of rice is separate.

## Ingredients

- 1 Cup Basmati Rice
- 2 cups Water 
- 1 Tablespoon Ghee
- 1 Bayleaf
- 1 inch Cinnamon (dalchini) Stick
- 4â€“5 Cloves
- 1 Teaspoon Jeera (Cumin Seeds)
- 1 Green Chilli (chopped finely)
- 1/2 Teaspoon Salt or to taste
- 2 Tablespoons chopped Coriander for garnishing

## Method

1. Wash the rice a few times, and then soak it in enough water so that the rice is soaked and has an inch of extra water on top. 
2. Soak the rice for at least 30 minutes.
3. Before cooking drain all the water from the rice and set the rice aside.
4. Heat ghee in a pot and add the whole spices and cumin seeds to it. 
5. Once the cumin seeds start spluttering, add the chopped green chilli and drained rice to it. 
6. Saute the rice in the pan for two minutes on a medium flame. This helps add more flavor to the rice.
7. Add two cups water and salt to the rice and mix well. 
8. Bring the rice to a quick boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. 
9. Cover and cook for approximately five to six minutes, till all the water has evaporated and the rice is cooked through. 
10. Top with chopped coriander and serve hot.
