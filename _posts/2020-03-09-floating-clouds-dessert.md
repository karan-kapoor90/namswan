A floating cloud is a dessert of French origin, consisting of meringue floating on a vanilla custard. The meringues are prepared from whipped egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract then quickly poached.

## Ingredients

- 3 Eggs
- 1/2 Cup white sugar 
- 1/4 Teaspoon salt 
- 1.5 Cups Whole Milk
- 1.5 Teaspoon Cardamom(elaichi) powder

## Method

1. Separate two of the eggs. In top of double boiler, combine 1 whole egg and 2 yolks with 1/4 cup sugar and the salt, whisking until smooth. 
2. Whisk in the milk and cook over simmering water, stirring constantly with a spatula or wooden spoon. 
3. When the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, remove it from the heat. (Do not boil. If custard should start to curdle, remove from heat and beat vigorously until smooth) 
4. Pour the custard through a strainer into a bowl and stir in the vanilla extract. Cool and refrigerate.
5. In a heat-proof bowl, lightly whisk the 2 egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, just enough to dissolve the sugar. 
6. Place the bowl on top of a pot of simmering water and stir constantly until the temperature of the whites reaches 145 degrees F (63 C) or hotter. 
7. Immediately remove the bowl from the heat, and use an electric mixer to beat the warm egg whites until they form stiff, glossy peaks.
8. Pour the chilled custard into a serving dish. Drop the meringue by heaping tablespoons onto the custard to make clouds. 
9. Chill before serving.
