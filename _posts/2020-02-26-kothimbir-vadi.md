I tried this when I had just started working in Mumbai, and I have to say, I am in love with it. 

## Ingredients

- 1 Cup Gram flour 
- Cup Green coriander (finely chopped)
- 1/4th Cup Peanuts (roasted and cleaned)
- Oil for frying
- 1/4th Teaspoon Red chilly powder
- 1/4th Teaspoon Cumin seeds 
- Less than 1/4th Teaspoon Turmeric powder 
- 1/2 Teaspoon Salt or as per taste)
Garam masala powder - less then ¼ tsp
Oil - 1 tbsp
Lemon juice - 1 tbsp
Green chilly - 1 (finely chopped)
Asafoetida - 1 pinch

## Method

1. Firstly take gram flour in any bowl and add ½ cup of water into it. Stir until all lumps get dissolved. Now add 2 cup more of water in the mixture and mix well. Add peanuts, green coriander, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, ginger paste, lemon juice, red chilly powder, green chilly, and asafoetida and mix all ingredients really well. Mixture is ready; now cook it.

Place any utensil with heavy bottom on the flame. Add 1 tbsp oil, when oil gets hot add cumin seeds. When cumin seeds crackles add gram flour mixture and stir constantly with help of a spoon. Cook the mixture until it starts boiling or it becomes thick or starts separating from the base or for 9-10 minutes on medium flame.

Grease a plate or tray with some oil and pour the cooked mixture into it. Keep it aside so that it gets set. It takes 20 minutes or ½ hour for mixture to set completely. After this, cut it into any shape of your preference.

Take oil in a pan and place it on flame for heating. When oil gets hot add gently place the pieces in the pan and fry until they turn golden brown in color. Take them out in a plate with absorbent paper. Like wise fry all pieces. Crunchy from top and soft from inside kothambir vadi is ready.

Serve kothambir vadi with green coriander chutney or coconut chutney or tomato sauce.

Suggestion:

If you wish to make kothambir vadi for any special occasion or party, then cook and set the gram flour mixture and place it in freezer. Fry them during the party and serve steaming hot kothambir vadi.
