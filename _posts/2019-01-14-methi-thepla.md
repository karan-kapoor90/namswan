## Ingredients

1. 1 cup methi (fenugreek) leaves tightly packed
2. 120 gm aata (whole wheat flour)
3. 1/4 cup (40 gm) besan (gram flour)
4. 1/4 cup (40 gm) bajra (pearl millet) {optional}
5. 1/4 cup (40 gm) jowar (sorghum) {optional}
6. 1/2 inch / 1 tea spoon adrak (ginger)
7. 1/2 teaspoon / 2 pieces green chillies
8. 1/2 teaspoon red chilly powder
9. 1/2 teaspoon haldi (turmeric)
10. 1/2 teaspoon jeera powder
11. 1/2 teaspoon dhaniya powder
12. 3/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
13. 1 tbsp oil
14. 4-5 tbsp yogurt or water for kneading
15. Oil for roasting

## Method

1. Rinse and drain methi, chop finely.
2. For the dough, in a bowl take 1 cup whole wheat flour, besan, bajra and jowar. If you don't have bajra and jowar, just add 1.25 cups of aata and 1/2 cup besan.
3. Add all dry herbs and spices
4. Now add curd and knead
5. Don't add water with methi leaves while kneading (they release water). Add curd if required
6. With the dough, make small balls and, using a rolling pin, roll out as chapatis but thinner. On a hot tawa, cook the thepla, generously adding oil (so they remain soft).
7. Serve with curd or green chilly pickle.
