Bhindi Do Pyaza is a North Indian dish made from Okra and Onions.

## Ingredients

- 500 grams okra (bhindi or lady fingers)
- 2 large onions (sliced)
- 1/2 Teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 Teaspoon Red chilly powder or to taste
- 1 teaspoon Dried Mango powder (amchur powder) 
- 1 teaspoon Garam Masala powder
- 3 to 3.5 tablespoons oil or ghee 
- 1/4th Teaspoon Salt as required

## Method

1. Wash the okra , then wipe them with a kitchen napkin. 
2. Now chop the okra into half-inch pieces. 
3. Slice the onions thinly.
4. In a pan or wok, add oil or ghee. Then add the chopped okra. 
5. Saute them on a low to medium flame till the okra become slightly tender.
6. Now add the sliced onions. Add all the dry masala powders except garam masala powder and amchur and mix well. 
7. Add salt too. Mix the okra well with the onions.
8. Cook on a slow flame till the okra has become tender and cooked. 
9. Donâ€™t overcook as the okra will get mushy.
10. Lastly, add the garam masala powder and amchur.
11. Mix the garam masala powder and amchur powder with the okra and onions.
12. Serve bhindi with rotis. 

NOTES:
- Always rinse the lady finger first and then wipe them dry and then chop them. If you just wash them and then chop them they become sticky, while chopping itself. Even while cooking them, they become slimy and mushy.
- Don't add water when making a recipe exclusively with okra as they become too sticky and mushy.
- I have not covered the pan in this recipe as I do not want the bhindi do pyaza to be slimy and sticky.
