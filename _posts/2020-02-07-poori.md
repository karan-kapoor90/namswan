Every Indian household's sunday brunch is incomplete without poori! Needless to say it's our comfort food. 

## Ingredients

- 1 Cup Whole Wheat flour(Atta)
- 1/2 Cup Water for kneading dough
- 1/4th Teaspoon Salt or to taste
- 1 Teaspoon Oil for dough
- Oil for frying

## Method

1. In a bowl knead Atta with oil. The consistency of the dough should be stiffer than regular chapatti dough. 
2. While rolling the poori's use oil instead of dry atta so they don't stick to the base. 
3. In a kadhai heat oil for frying poori.
4. On high flame, once the oil is hot, add the flattened dough and with a broad spatula (metallic with holes) press the poori down so they come out round.
5. Let excess oil drip out in a colander or strainer.
6. Serve hot.
