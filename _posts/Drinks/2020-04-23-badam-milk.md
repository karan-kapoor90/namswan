Refreshing Badam Milk is a popular Indian drink made with milk and fresh almond paste. It’s flavored with cardamom and saffron making it an aromatic & flavorful drink!

## Ingredients

- 35 almonds
- 1 liter Full Fat Milk
- Pinch saffron (dissolved in 1 tablespoon milk)
- 4-6 tablespoons granulated white sugar or to taste
- 5-6 green cardamom pods (seeds removed & crushed to a fine powder)

## Method

1. Soak almond in hot water for 20 minutes. 
2. After 20 minutes, discard the water and then remove the skin from each almond. It will come off easily.
3. Transfer blanched almonds with 1/4th cup milk to a blender. Blend to a smooth paste. Set it aside.
4. Now transfer the remaining milk to a pan and put in on medium-high heat.
5. As the milk warms up, take out 1 tablespoon of the warm milk from the pan into a small bowl and add crushed saffron strands to it. Set aside.
6. Once the milk in the pan comes to a boil, add the prepared almond paste to it. Stir to combine.
7. Lower the heat to low medium and let the milk simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. 
8. Stir often so that milk doesn’t stick to the pan. The raw smell of almonds should disappear completely.
9. Add in the saffron milk.
10. Now add the sugar and stir until it dissolves.
11. Finally add the crushed cardamom seeds. 
12. Mix everything together and turn off the heat.
13. Serve badam milk hot or cold.
