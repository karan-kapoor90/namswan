My all time favourite, this was one dessert I've always had as a kid on Diwali. While making this the aroma takes me back to sweet childhood memories. No amount of word can do justice to the warm fuzzy feels you get when this dissolves in your mouth.

## Ingredients

- 1 Cup Gram flour (besan)
- 3/4th Cup Powdered Sugar
- 1/2 Cup Ghee
- 1 Teaspoon Cardamom (elaichi) Powder
- Roasted Almonds to taste

## Method

1. Sift the Besan. Keep aside.
2. In a kadhai add ghee and besan, sautee on slow gas till it changes colour to a dark brown and leaves aroma(takes about half an hour)
3. For besan burfi, heat the sugar while the gas is on.
4. Transfer into the container in which the burfi will has to be set (make sure it is heat resistant and shallow)
5. Let it naturally cool a little and the put it in the fridge for a while till it completely cools down. 
6. Cut into squares or diamond shape and serve.
