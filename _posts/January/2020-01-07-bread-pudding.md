## Ingredients

- 1 cap Vanilla essence

## Method

1. Butter four slices of bread, cut each slice into 4 pieces.
2. In an oven/microwave proof bowl place the slices in the form of a fallen domino(each slice should over lap the other just a little).
3. Take a bowl, add one glass milk and add egg and sugar to taste. Mix completely.

5. Sprinkle sugar ontop.
6. Bake immediately.
