Our favourite go to gujju snack! Like Kareena Kapoor Khan said in 3 Idiots "missiles jaise naam!", this one does justice with the burst of flavours in your mouth.

## Ingredients

- 1 Cup Methi Leaves (fenugreek leaves) tightly packed
- 1 Cup Atta (120 grams)
- 1/4th Cup or 40 grams Besan
- 1/4th Cup or 40 grams Bajra (Pearl millet) - optional
- 1/4th Cup or 40 grams Jowar (sorghum flour) - optional
- 1/2 inch or 1 Teaspoon Ginger (Adrak)
- 1/2 Teaspoon Green Chillies (2 nos)
- 1/2 Teaspoon Red chilly powder
- 1/2 Teaspoon Turmeric Powder (haldi)
- 1/2 Teaspoon Cumin powder (jeera powder)
- 1/2 Teaspoon Dhaniya powder 
- 3/4th Teaspoon Salt or as required
- 1 Tablespoon Oil
- 4-5 Tablespoon Yougurt or water for kneading
- Oil for Roasting

## Method

1. Rinse and drain methi, chop finely.
2. For the dough, in a bowl take one cup whole Wheat Flour, Besan, Bajra and Jowar.
3. If you don't have Bajra and Jowar, just add 1.25 cup of Atta and Besan. 
4. Add all dry herbs and spices. Now add curd and knead. 
5. Don't add water with the Methi Leaves while kneading(they release water).
6. Add more curd if required. 
7. With the dough make small balls and using a rolling pin, roll out as chapatis but thinner. 
8. On a hot tawa put the thepla generously adding oil (so they remain soft).
9. Serve with instant green chilly pickle or curd.
