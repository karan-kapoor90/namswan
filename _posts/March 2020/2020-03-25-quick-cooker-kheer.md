Traditional Kheer is made over the stove by boiling whole milk, then soaked rice and sugar added and simmered till you get thick and creamy dessert, we're sharing one here with double the taste and half the effort. 

## Ingredients

- 1.5 liter Milk
- 8 Tablespoons Sugar (or according to taste)
- 6 Tablespoons Basmati Rice (soaked for 10 mins)
- 1/2 Teaspoon of Cardamom Seeds (crushed)
- Raisins (according to taste)- optional
- Almonds (according to taste crushed) - optional
- 1/4 cup of water

## Method

1. Take a pressure cooker, pour the milk in it, add sugar, water and set it on high heat. Keep stirring and bring it to a boil (Make sure that the milk does not burn)
2. Add the crushed cardamom and rice.
3. Close the lid of the pressure cooker and let the whistle blow once, then reduce the heat to between low and medium high and let cook for the next 15 minutes.
4. Now switch off the heat and let the pressure release naturally. (This is very important, as this is what will give the kheer its red colour and consistency)
5. Once cool, open the lid and add the dry fruits.
6. Serve hot or cold.
