Sabudana Khichdi is a dish commonly made in India during the fasting season of Navratri. Spicy Sabudana Khichdi is a traditional Indian breakfast recipe which is made using sago pearls.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup sabudana (sago/tapioca pearls)
- 1 cup water
- 1 Tablespoon oil
- 1/2 Teaspoon Cumin Seeds
- 1 medium Potato (diced small)
- 2 Tablespoons Raw Peanuts
- 1-2 Green chili (chopped) 
- 6-7 Curry leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar, optional
- 1/2 lemon juice 
- 1 tablespoon coriander (chopped)

## Method

1. Rinse sabudana under water until water turns clear. This helps get rid of starch.
2. Transfer the rinsed sabudana to a large bowl and add 1 cup water to it. No more.
3. In the morning the sabudana would have soaked up all the water. But you still drain it using a colander just to get rid of any excess water.
4. To check if sabudana is ready to cook, press a pearl between your thumb and index finger. It should smash easily. Set it aside.
5. Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for few seconds.
6. Then add the diced potatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes stirring often until potatoes are almost cooked. It's important to dice the potatoes small here so that cook quickly.
7. Add the raw peanuts and saute for another 2-3 minutes.
8. Then add the curry leaves and cook for another minute.
9. Add the drained sabudana to the pan along with salt and sugar. Mix until well combined.
10. Cook for few minutes until most of the sabudana pearls become translucent, stirring once or twice. Do not cook it for a long time else it will become sticky. 
11. Remove pan from heat. Add lemon juice and coriander and toss to combine.
12. Serve sabudana khichdi hot
