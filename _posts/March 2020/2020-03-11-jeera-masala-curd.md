Simple and refreshing! We typically enjoy eating it with our parathas.

- Pinch Black salt or Salt
- Milk or Water to dilute (optional)

1. Whisk all ingredients together. 
2. If the consistency is thick, add water or milk. 
3. Refrigerate and serve cold. 

Note: Adding milk gives the raita a richer note.
