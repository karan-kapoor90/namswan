Simple and refreshing with a crunchy note! We typically enjoy eating it with our summer mid day meals.

## Ingredients

- 2 Cups curd
- 1/4 Teaspoon Cumin (jeera) Powder
- Pinch Black salt or Salt
- Milk or Water to dilute (optional)
- 1/4th cup Boondi

## Method

1. Whisk all ingredients together. 
2. If the consistency is thick, add water or milk. 
3. Refrigerate.
4. Add Boondi just before serving and serve cold. 

Note: Adding milk gives the raita a richer note. 
Don't add boondi before hand since it'll become soggy.
