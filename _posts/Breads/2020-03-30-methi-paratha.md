Whole wheat flatbread with fresh fenugreek leaves. Methi Paratha are delicious, healthy and taste great with pickle or fresh butter!

## Ingredients

- 250 grams Methi (leaves)
- 2 onions
- 2 Tablespoon Oil
- 1.5 Teaspoon/5-6 Green chilles or to taste
- 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
- 2.5 Cups

## Method

1. Wash methi. 
2. Coarsely cut Methi, cut onions into 4. 
3. Add methi, onion, oil, salt, green chillies in an osterizer or mixi and blend them well. 
4. Add the paste in a kneading bowl and add atta to it and form a dough (if you plan to keep the dough and use it later, remember the onion will release oil so adjust the consistency of your dough accordingly). 
5. Take a spoon of dough and make it into a round ball.
5. Dust it with wheat flour.
6. With a rolling pin, roll it into a flat chapati shape(just a little thicker) 
7. Heat tawa, once hot, place the Methi paratha on it.
8. Once golden brown spots start appearing on the paratha, flip and cook the other side. 
9. When you flip the second time, you will notice airpockets form in the paratha, lightly press them so the air disperses into the flat sides making the paratha rise.
10. Grease the paratha with ghee and serve hot with curd.
