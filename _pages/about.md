Hello!!

> We are Gurmehar and Karan, and we're SUPER passionate about easy cooking, and experimenting with food. 

Want to try making something new or delicious today? Maybe surprise your wife or your kids with a dish they'd consider well above your skill level? We've got you covered! We've put together dishes that are scrumptuous, hearty and can be cooked at home without being an ace chef. 

Here's presenting pandoras recipe box that's been handed down from my mum, both my grandmas, masi's and maami! All recipes have stood the test of time and generation, they've enjoyed these and so can you. 

We love keeping cooking simple, easy and fun, and we hope this website helps you do the same! 

**PS:** Give us a shoutout on social media, or share our content. It takes a lot of time and effort to put this out to the world, and we hope you'd help us spread the love!

Peace
